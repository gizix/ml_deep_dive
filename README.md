# PyTorch Deep Learning Project

## Overview
This project follows the [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA) by freeCodeCamp.org. It's focused on implementing foundational deep learning and machine learning concepts using PyTorch.

## Installation
To set up the project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gizix/ml_deep_dive.git`
2. Install dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create and activate a Python virtual environment if necessary).

## Usage
- Explore the Jupyter Notebook `pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb` for core PyTorch concepts.
- Run tests in the `tests` directory for understanding model performance.

## Features
- Comprehensive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating PyTorch basics.
- Structured test cases for model validation.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the project, make changes, and submit a pull request. Bug reports and feature suggestions are also welcome.
